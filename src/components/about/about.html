        and so my first "Hello World" was done in Python.<br /><br /> I stayed with Python for around four months and

        my cousin that is a Front-End Engineer showed me HTML, CSS and Javascript. After that day
        I turned all my studies routine to learn web-development.<br /><br /> And it's leads me towards here to
