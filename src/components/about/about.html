        <span class="first-letter">H</span>ello, my name is <strong>Filipe Cancellier da Costa</strong>. <br /><br />
        I have a graduation in Civil Engineering and I'm originally from Brazil.<br /><br />
        My career is resumed to engineering jobs, so I all my professionals skill are turned to this area, but I was
        felling that something was missing, I wasn't totally happy in Civil Engineer area, so I decided to try another thing.
        I always enjoyed computer, games and technology so I thought "Why not try codding?", and so I did.<br /><br />
        I started my studies in codding in 2018, and at that time I started studying <a class="siteLink"
          href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and so my first "Hello World" was done in Python. The codding was
        nice, all the logic and the algorithms, I was really enjoying that, but I wasn't felling good about the language, I mean
        Python is an amazing language, but for a start, you would like to see thing happen on screen, and not only numbers.<br />
        So I had a conversation with my cousin, that is a Front-End Engineer, and he showed me
        <a class="siteLink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>,
        <a class="siteLink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> and
        <a class="siteLink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a>,
        he said that maybe I would like it more than python.
        After that day I turned all my studies routine to learn web-development.<br />
        It's so nice to learn web, because you can see everything that you code in front of you and can see 
        how much do you progress every single day.<br /><br />
        I still studying every day, but I don't fell that I already have enough for a job in web area,
        so when I heard about Founders and Coders
        I thought that this is the perfect opportunity for me to learn more a get the confidence to start a career in this area.

        Founders and Coders seems to be a great community, fulled with people who want to lean an who want to help, it really look like a nice
        place be your first step in your programming career. And thats why I'm looking forward to be part of this program, and learn as much as I can!
